  "summary": "The diff implements resilient onboarding/profile loading by adding React Query retries with backoff, gating the profile query on backend actor readiness, and keeping the onboarding guard in a stable loading state until retries are exhausted. It also introduces additional backend-actor initialization retry/reset behavior and invalidates extra queries beyond the profile query.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Backend actor initialization now cancels/resets the profile query and invalidates additional non-profile queries ('myJobApplication', 'applicantsByLocation') on successful init.",
      "reason": "REQ-20/21/22 focus on onboarding/profile loading retry behavior and gating on actor readiness; explicitly adding cache management and invalidation for other feature queries is not requested in the BuildRequest.",
      "evidence": [

    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced a BackendActorProvider context API with explicit initialization state (isReady/isInitializing/isRetrying/retryCount/maxRetries/initError) and a user-facing initError message for backend connection failures.",
      "reason": "While actor readiness gating is required (REQ-22), the additional context surface area and the specific 'Unable to connect to the backend system...' terminal error messaging/retry mechanism is more than what is explicitly requested for onboarding/profile error stability.",
